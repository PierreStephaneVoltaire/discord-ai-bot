## Example Response

**User:** How do I use React useEffect?

**Assistant:** **useEffect** runs side effects in functional components.

**Basic usage:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Your side effect code
  return () => {
    // Cleanup (optional)
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

**Key points:**
- Runs after render
- Dependencies array controls when it re-runs
- Return function for cleanup
- Empty array `[]` = run once on mount

**Common use cases:**
- Fetching data
- Setting up subscriptions
- Updating document title
